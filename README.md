# KSP-Auto-landing (beta)
*Some python scripts enable your Kerbal rocket to land (safely, hopefully) at a fixed point*

---

### CAUTION: 
This project is still **IN EARLY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT**, therefore some functions may not yet completed and buggy.

---

### TODOï¼š
- [x] Fix autopilot problems  
- [ ] Add a boosterback burn and sea landing general sequence  
- [ ] Improve control algorithm performance (against huge aerodynamic force)  
      *I'm learning to solve this problem and hope someone can help me*ðŸ˜¢

---

### Usage:
To run the code:
`python landing.py`
