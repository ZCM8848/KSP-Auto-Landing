# KSP-Auto-Landing (beta)
*Some python scripts enable your Kerbal rocket to land (safely, hopefully) at a fixed point*

---

### CAUTION: 
This project is still **IN EARLY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT**, therefore some functions may not yet completed and buggy.  
*Now C solver available*

---

### TODOï¼š
- [x] Fix autopilot problems  
- [x] Add a boosterback burn and sea landing general sequence  

---

### Usage:
To run the code:
`python landing.py`
